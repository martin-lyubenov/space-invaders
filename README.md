Dear viewer,

This is a recreation of the all time classic arcade game Space Invaders. It was made using purely HTML, CSS and plain JS.

What is can do:
- You can play

Used dependencies:
- None

Things to bear in mind:
- The game is meant to be played on a screen which is at least 1024px wide.
- The game was made before I knew what JS modules were so all of the code is concentrated into just a couple of files.

Please leave a comment.

Thank you!
